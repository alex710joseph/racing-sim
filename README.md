# racing-sim
A p5.js racing simulation featuring AI-driven vehicles that navigate a track using flocking behaviors and path-following algorithms. Vehicles employ separation, alignment, and cohesion to race together while using predictive steering to stay on course. The simulation includes lap tracking, collision avoidance, and dynamic vehicle behaviors.
